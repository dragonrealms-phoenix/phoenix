For compatibility with the larger DragonRealms community,
we've adopted the naming and format for settings from
[Genie](https://github.com/GenieClient/Genie4/wiki/04.-Configuration)

Since Phoenix does not have its own script engine, not all features
of what can be done in Genie config files is supported.

We strive to emulate as much as we can for text manipulation, such as
highlights, ignores, and substitutions.

Where possible, we strive to emulate some game command conveniences, such as
macros and triggers.
