# Privacy Statement

Welcome to Phoenix! We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your data. This privacy statement outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information.

## Information We Collect

1. **DragonRealms Credentials**: In order for Phoenix to function, we require your DragonRealms play.net account username and password. These credentials are securely saved on your device using the password storage features of your operating system (e.g., macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux password storage).

2. **Character Names**: We collect the names of the game characters you log in as. This information is used solely for the convenience of quick login and is stored locally on your device.

3. **Error Logging**: Phoenix utilizes Sentry.io to collect error logs. However, rest assured that only app-specific details necessary for troubleshooting and bug fixing are shared with Sentry.io. No personally identifiable information (PII) or play.net account information is shared.

## How We Use Your Information

- **DragonRealms Credentials**: Your play.net account username and password are used solely for the purpose of logging you into the DragonRealms game. We do not store or transmit this information to any third parties.

- **Character Names**: We save the character names you use for quicker access to the game. This information is only stored locally on your device and is not shared with anyone.

- **Error Logging**: Error logs collected by Sentry.io are used exclusively for identifying and resolving issues within Phoenix. They do not contain any personal or sensitive information.

## Data Security

We take your data security seriously. Your DragonRealms credentials are securely stored on your device using industry-standard encryption technologies and the built-in password storage features of your operating system. This means on macOS, we use macOS Keychain; on Windows, we use Windows Credential Manager; and on Linux (Ubuntu/Debian), we use the native password storage mechanisms.
